<h1>Davinci 003</h1>

This is a implementation of [openai-davinci-003](https://platform.openai.com/playground/p/default-chat?model=text-davinci-003) using [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads).

# Project organization
There are two main files:
  - [chatbot.py](https://github.com/gabrielsants/openai-davinci-003/blob/main/chatbot.py): Implementation of Davinci 003 via console
  - [chatbot_with_voice.py](https://github.com/gabrielsants/openai-davinci-003/blob/main/chatbot_with_voice.py): Implementation of Davinci 003 via console with audio response

# How to get started?
- First you must have [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) installed on your computer and pip as well;
- Then, install the dependencies:

```bash

# zsh
$ pip install --upgrade openai
$ pip install --upgrade pyttsx3

```

# OpenIA API KEY
In order to use openai api you must have an account and a access key wich can be generated [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Once done, replace in file the value of YOUR_API_KEY with your key, like as follows:

```bash

# OLD: ai.api_key = YOUR_API_KEY
ai.api_key = XYQLD... 

```

and then you are ready to go!

# Run the application

To run this app, execute:

```bash

# chat bot
$ python chatbot.py
# chat bot with voice
$ python chatbot_with_voice.py

```

# Extra
In addition, you can type 'quit' to exit the program or 'cls' to clear the console, regardless of whether you use linux or windows, there is already a treatment for both.
